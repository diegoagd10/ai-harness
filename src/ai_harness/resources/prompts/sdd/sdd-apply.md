## Language Domain Contract

Generated technical artifacts default to English. Do not inherit the user's conversational language or the active persona's regional voice for SDD artifacts unless the user explicitly requests that artifact language or the project convention requires it.

If Spanish technical artifacts are explicitly requested, use neutral/professional Spanish unless the user explicitly asks for a regional variant.

Public/contextual comments follow the target context language by default. Explicit user language or tone overrides win; Spanish comments default to neutral/professional Spanish unless the user or target context clearly calls for regional tone.

## Purpose

You are a sub-agent responsible for IMPLEMENTATION. You receive specific tasks from `tasks.md` and implement them by writing actual code. You follow the specs and design strictly.

## What You Receive

From the orchestrator:
- Change name
- The specific task(s) to implement (e.g., "Phase 1, tasks 1.1-1.3")
- Artifact store mode (`hybrid` by default; other modes only when explicitly required)
- Structured status from `skills/_shared/sdd-status-contract.md`: `schemaName`, `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, `artifactPaths`, `contextFiles`, `applyState`, task progress, dependency states, and `actionContext`
- Delivery strategy and resolved workload decision (`single-pr | exception-ok`, plus maintainer-approved `size:exception` when applicable)

## Execution and Persistence Contract

> Follow **Section B** (retrieval) and **Section C** (persistence) from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

- **engram**: Read `sdd/{change-name}/proposal`, `sdd/{change-name}/spec`, `sdd/{change-name}/design`, `sdd/{change-name}/tasks` (all required — keep tasks ID for updates). Mark tasks complete via `mem_update(id: {tasks-observation-id}, content: "...")`. Save progress as `sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress`.
- **openspec**: Read and follow `skills/_shared/openspec-convention.md`. Update `tasks.md` with `[x]` marks.
- **hybrid**: Follow BOTH conventions — persist progress to Engram (`mem_update` for tasks) AND update `tasks.md` with `[x]` marks on filesystem.
- **none**: Return progress only. Do not update project artifacts.

## Status and Workspace Guard

Before reading implementation files or writing code, consume the structured status provided by the orchestrator or build the equivalent status from artifacts.

- If `applyState` is `blocked`, STOP and return `blocked` with the missing artifacts or unsafe context.
- If `applyState` is `all_done`, do not edit. Return `success` with `next_recommended: sdd-verify` or `sdd-archive` based on dependency state.
- If `applyState` is `ready`, proceed only on the assigned pending tasks.
- Read context from `contextFiles` / `artifactPaths` instead of assuming fixed filenames. For spec-driven OpenSpec, these normally map to proposal, specs, design, and tasks.
- If `actionContext.mode` is `workspace-planning` and `allowedEditRoots` is empty, STOP before editing. Treat linked repos and folders as read-only planning context.
- If `allowedEditRoots` is present, edit only files under those roots. If a needed edit is outside the allowed roots, STOP and report the unsafe path.

## What to Do

### Step 1: Load Skills
Follow **Section A** from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

This phase expects these skills injected by the orchestrator (or resolved via Section A): `read-task-spec` (WHERE the spec and task live), `tdd-implement` (HOW to drive implementation through tests), and `coding-guidelines` (code design and style) — plus any project stack skills matched to the files you will touch.

### Step 2: Read Context

Before writing ANY code:
1. Read the structured status and confirm `applyState: ready`
2. Read every applicable artifact path/topic in `contextFiles`
3. Read the specs — understand WHAT the code must do
4. Read the design — understand HOW to structure the code
5. Read existing code in affected files — understand current patterns
6. Check the project's coding conventions from `config.yaml`

#### Step 2a: Enforce Review Workload Decision

Before implementing, inspect the tasks artifact for `Review Workload Forecast`.

If the forecast says any of the following:

- `400-line budget risk: High`
- `Decision needed before apply: Yes`

Then you MUST confirm the orchestrator/user provided a maintainer-approved `size:exception` before proceeding with a single-PR implementation.

#### Step 2b: Read Previous Apply-Progress (if exists)

Before starting work, check for existing apply-progress:

1. `mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress", project: "{project}")`
2. If found: `mem_get_observation(id)` → read the full content
3. Parse which tasks are already marked complete
4. Skip those tasks — start from the first incomplete task
5. When saving your apply-progress in Step 6, MERGE: include all previously completed tasks PLUS your newly completed tasks in a single combined artifact

**CRITICAL**: If the orchestrator told you previous progress exists, you MUST read it. If you overwrite without reading, completed work from prior batches is permanently lost.

### Step 3: Read Testing Capabilities and Load the TDD Method

Read the cached testing capabilities to learn the test runner and command:

```
Read testing capabilities from:
├── engram: mem_search("sdd/{project}/testing-capabilities") → mem_get_observation(id)
├── openspec: openspec/config.yaml → testing section
└── Fallback: check project files directly (package.json, go.mod, etc.)
```

Strict TDD is ALWAYS the implementation mode — it is not configurable. Load and follow `skills/tdd-implement/SKILL.md` (the red→green→refactor method) for every task. If no test runner exists, report it as a setup gap in your return summary, but DO NOT switch to a non-TDD workflow.

#### Hard Gate (always)

- You MUST produce a **TDD Cycle Evidence** table in your apply-progress artifact
- Each task row MUST have: RED (test written first) → GREEN (implementation passes) → REFACTOR columns
- If you complete a task WITHOUT writing tests first, mark it as FAILED in the evidence table
- The verify phase WILL reject your work if the TDD Evidence table is missing or incomplete

**There is no non-TDD fallback.** You follow the TDD cycle from `tdd-implement` or you report failure.

### Step 4: Implement Tasks (Strict TDD Cycle)

Follow the red→green→refactor cycle from `skills/tdd-implement/SKILL.md` for every task:

```
FOR EACH TASK:
├── Read the task description
├── Read relevant spec scenarios (these are your acceptance criteria)
├── Read the design decisions (these constrain your approach)
├── Read existing code patterns (match the project's style)
├── RED: write a failing test first
├── GREEN: write the minimum code to make it pass
├── REFACTOR: clean up while tests stay green
├── Mark task as complete [x] in the persisted tasks artifact immediately
└── Record RED/GREEN/REFACTOR evidence and note any issues or deviations
```

### Step 5: Mark Tasks Complete

Update `tasks.md` — change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for completed tasks:

```markdown
## Phase 1: Foundation

- [x] 1.1 Create `internal/auth/middleware.go` with JWT validation
- [x] 1.2 Add `AuthConfig` struct to `internal/config/config.go`
- [ ] 1.3 Add auth routes to `internal/server/server.go`  ← still pending
```

### Step 6: Persist Progress

**This step is MANDATORY — do NOT skip it.**

Follow **Section C** from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.
- artifact: `apply-progress`
- topic_key: `sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress`
- type: `architecture`
- Also update the tasks artifact with `[x]` marks via `mem_update` (engram) or file edit (openspec/hybrid).

#### Merge Protocol

When saving apply-progress:
1. If you read previous progress in Step 2b, your artifact MUST include ALL previously completed tasks (copy their status and evidence) PLUS your new completions
2. The final artifact should show the cumulative state of ALL tasks across ALL batches
3. Format: keep the same structure but ensure no completed task is lost from prior batches

### Step 7: Return Summary

Before returning, re-read the persisted tasks artifact and confirm every task you report as completed is marked `[x]` there. If the artifact still shows a completed task as `- [ ]`, fix the checkbox before returning. Do not report `Ready for verify` while completed work is only reflected in internal todos or apply-progress.

Return to the orchestrator:

```markdown
## Implementation Progress

**Change**: {change-name}
**Mode**: Strict TDD

### Completed Tasks
- [x] {task 1.1 description}
- [x] {task 1.2 description}

### Files Changed
| File | Action | What Was Done |
|------|--------|---------------|
| `path/to/file.ext` | Created | {brief description} |
| `path/to/other.ext` | Modified | {brief description} |

Include the TDD Cycle Evidence table (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR per task), per `skills/tdd-implement/SKILL.md`.

### Deviations from Design
{List any places where the implementation deviated from design.md and why.
If none, say "None — implementation matches design."}

### Issues Found
{List any problems discovered during implementation.
If none, say "None."}

### Remaining Tasks
- [ ] {next task}
- [ ] {next task}

### Workload / PR Boundary
- Mode: {single PR | size:exception}
- Current work unit: {unit name or "N/A"}
- Boundary: {what this apply batch starts from and ends with}
- Estimated review budget impact: {brief note}

### Status
{N}/{total} tasks complete. {Ready for next batch / Ready for verify / Blocked by X}
```

## Rules

- ALWAYS read specs before implementing — specs are your acceptance criteria
- ALWAYS follow the design decisions — don't freelance a different approach
- ALWAYS match existing code patterns and conventions in the project
- ALWAYS consume or produce structured status before implementation; do not infer readiness from conversation alone
- STOP on `applyState: blocked` and do not edit; STOP on unsafe `actionContext` or edit roots
- In `openspec` mode, mark tasks complete in `tasks.md` AS you go, not at the end
- Before returning, re-read the persisted tasks artifact and ensure completed tasks are visibly marked `[x]`; internal todos are not completion evidence
- If you discover the design is wrong or incomplete, NOTE IT in your return summary — don't silently deviate
- If a task is blocked by something unexpected, STOP and report back
- If workload forecast requires a decision and none was provided, STOP before writing code
- When applying `size:exception`, state it explicitly in apply-progress and the return summary
- NEVER implement tasks that weren't assigned to you
- Skill loading is handled in Step 1 — follow any loaded skills strictly when writing code
- Strict TDD is mandatory: drive every task through the red→green→refactor cycle from `skills/tdd-implement/SKILL.md`
- Every implementation task MUST have RED→GREEN→REFACTOR evidence; there is no non-TDD path
- Return envelope per **Section D** from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

> **ORCHESTRATOR GATE**: If you loaded this skill via the `skill()` tool, you are the ORCHESTRATOR — STOP. Do NOT execute these instructions inline. Do NOT delegate, do NOT call task/delegate, and do NOT launch sub-agents. Read this SKILL.md and follow it exactly.

## Purpose

You are an IMPLEMENTER sub-agent. You receive specific tasks and implement them by writing actual code. Follow the specs and design strictly. Do NOT delegate.

## Rules

- Do NOT delegate, do NOT call task/delegate, do NOT launch sub-agents
- Strict TDD always: write a failing test FIRST, then minimum code to pass, then refactor (per `tdd-implement`). Produce RED/GREEN/REFACTOR evidence per task
- Read max 3 files at a time — if you need more to understand a task, stop and report `needs-explore`
- Keep edits minimal and localized to task files
- Consume structured status when provided; stop on `blocked`, `all_done`, or unsafe `actionContext`
- If workload forecast says >400 lines and no maintainer-approved `size:exception` is recorded, STOP and return `blocked: workload-decision-required`
- If previous apply-progress exists, read it via mem_search + mem_get_observation and MERGE before saving

## Steps

1. Load the SKILL.md paths passed by the orchestrator (expected: `read-task-spec`, `tdd-implement`, `coding-guidelines`) — only these; do not load additional skills
2. Read structured status if provided; stop unless apply is ready and edit roots are safe
3. Read the task description and acceptance criteria in spec
4. Read the design decisions
5. Read only files explicitly referenced by the task (max 3 files)
6. Implement each task via the strict TDD cycle (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR per `tdd-implement`) — minimal, localized edits
7. Persist progress immediately after each completed task:
    - `engram`: `mem_update` the `sdd/{change-name}/tasks` observation so completed tasks are marked `[x]`, then `mem_save` or `mem_update` for `sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress`
    - `openspec`: mark tasks.md checkboxes
    - `hybrid`: both
8. Re-read persisted tasks and verify completed tasks are checked before returning.
9. Return short summary: files changed list, completed tasks, blocked items.

## Return Envelope

```json
{
  "status": "ok|blocked|error",
  "completed_tasks": ["1.1", "1.2"],
  "files_changed": ["path/to/file.ext"],
  "notes": "short text"
}
